          <p>Good morning, Kathryn! 😁</p>
          <p>I have been hard at work making the most of the extra time that I have now that side work is done.</p>
          <p>
            I have accounted for what I can, and hopefully everything will work correctly. If you do not know an answer,
            feel free to guess a few times or use Google(there will be hints).

            The important thing is that you hold off calling me, so that you can get the full experience. If something
            breaks for realz(I hope it will not), then you can give me a call.

            The best that I can do is try to make it fun for you.
